Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. we create data structure once,but use data structure again and again. When we create is going to save in memory
and then its easily we can use.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. searching, deleting,inserting,shorting,merging etc Various operations that can be performed on different data structures.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Compiler design, operating system, database management system,graphics,simulation,statistical analysis package etc.

what is an Array?
A. An Array is a data structure that contains a group of elements.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array is static in size that is fixed length data structure. we cannot change array object.
Arraylist is grows in size dynamicly.

what is LinkedList?
 A. LinkedList is a linear data structure, Where each element is a separate object.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. In array, each element is independent,no connection with previous elements.
In linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.

what is queue?
A. Queue is a subtype of java.util.collection interface. In queue have designed elements inserted and removed FIFO
and LILO.
what is stack?
A. A stack is a data structure that allows data to be inserted and removed .In stack data to be inserted and removed LIFO
 and FILO.
what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO is first in and first out. LIFO is last in first out.

what is the order of complexity?
A.  The order of complexity is the big O notation and an order of efficiency of algorithms. It can be used for space complexity or time complexity.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. The best case running time of an algorithm is the function defined by the
   minimum number of steps taken on any instance of size.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst case running time of an algorithm is the function defined by
   the maximum number of steps taken on any instance of size n.

what is tree in data structure?
A. In data structure Tree are made up of nodes.A common kind of tree is a binary tree.In that case which each
node contains reference to two other nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
A. A graph is an object consisting of a vertex set and edge set.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. The difference between the HashMap and HashTable is HashMap allows null key value and it is not syncronized.
HashTable doesn,t allows null key value and it is syncronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
A. HasMap works in java based on the Hashing principle,but it si not a simple as it is sound.A true Hashing mechanism
 should always return the same Hashcode()when it is applied to the same object.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
 A. In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address of elements is stored in the link part of previous element/node.
What is Recursion?
A. Recursion is a method of solving problems that involves breaking  down into smaller and smaller sub problems
until you get to a small enough problem that is can be solved trivially.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Linear data structure which all the data are arranged in sequence manner,and non-linear data structure are in which
all the data are arranged in Random manner.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O notation is the language we use for articulating how long an algorithm takes to run.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. Efficient sorts[edit] Practical general sorting algorithms are almost always based on an algorithm with average time complexity
of which the most common are heapsort,marge sort,quicksort.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
